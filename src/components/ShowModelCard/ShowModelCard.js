                        <br /><strong>Random Forest Regression</strong><br /> is a supervised learning algorithm that uses ensemble learning method for regression. Ensemble learning method is a technique that combines predictions from multiple machine learning algorithms to make a more accurate prediction than a single model.

                        The diagram above shows the structure of a Random Forest. You can notice that the trees run in parallel with no interaction amongst them. A Random Forest operates by constructing several decision trees during training time and outputting the mean of the classes as the prediction of all the trees. To get a better understanding of the Random Forest algorithm, letâ€™s walk through the steps:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Pick at random k data points from the training set</li>
                            <li>Build a decision tree associated to these k data points.</li>
                            <li>Choose the number N of trees you want to build and repeat steps 1 and 2.</li>
                            <li>For a new data point, make each one of your N-tree trees predict the value of y for the data point in question and assign the new data point to the average across all of the predicted y values.</li>

                        </ol>
                        A Random Forest Regression model is powerful and accurate. It usually performs great on many problems, including features with non-linear relationships. Disadvantages, however, include the following: there is no interpretability, overfitting may easily occur, we must choose the number of trees to include in the model.
